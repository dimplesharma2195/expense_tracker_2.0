# Creating Signup Screen

## Deliverables

1. **Create the signup screen** as shown in the design: [Signup Screen Reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlQsBXuQux-aDpp2gqud_K0xlnJAap69/view?usp=sharing). This screen will allow new users to sign up.

2. **Fields to include:**
   - Email
   - Password
   - Confirm Password
   
   All fields are **mandatory**. Users should not be able to submit the form until all fields are filled correctly.

3. **Use Google Firebase Authentication** (similar to previous implementations) to register new users. Once registered, the user should be able to log in from this screen.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle errors appropriately.
   - Display relevant error messages to users, ensuring a smooth user experience.

5. **Success Message:**
   - Once a user has successfully registered, log the following message in the console: 
     ```
     User has successfully signed up
     ```
