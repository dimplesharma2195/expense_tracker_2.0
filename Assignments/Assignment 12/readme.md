## Deliverable

1. **Can you add an action type `INCREMENTBY2`**, which increases the counter by 2 when dispatched?
2. **Can you add an action type `DECREMENTBY2`**, which decreases the counter by 2 when dispatched?

Try implementing these actions in your Redux reducer and dispatching them to observe the behavior!
