# Login Screen

## Deliverables

1. **User Login Functionality:**
   - Once a user is successfully created, they should be able to log in going forward.

2. **Create the Login Screen** as shown in the design: [Login Screen Reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrrnlwyWW9gX6uD-gAYx06b7-bBfkz2L/view?usp=sharing).

3. **Use Firebase Email Authentication:**
   - Implement login functionality using Firebase email authentication, just like before.
   - Refer to the Firebase documentation for guidance, but try implementing it on your own first.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - If a user enters incorrect credentials, display an alert message informing them of the issue.

5. **Token Storage:**
   - When the user successfully logs in, store the authentication token received from Firebase as done previously.

6. **Post-Login Screen:**
   - On successful login, navigate the user to a dummy screen displaying the message: 
     **"Welcome to Expense Tracker"**
