# Introduction to Redux

## Watch the video 1 and 2 from the following link and answer the following:

- What are the different types of state?
- What is the difference between each one of them? Explain with examples.
- What is prop drilling? How did Context API of React solve this problem of prop drilling?

---

## Watch video 3 from the above link and answer the following:

- What are the disadvantages of using Context API? Explain with your own examples.
- When should you use Context then?

---

## Watch video 4 from the above link and answer the following:

> **Guys, Redux is like Context API but more performant and easy to manage. That's it. We use it on all React apps. So super important to understand it.**

- What is the central state?
- What does it mean by a component has subscribed to the central state?
- Can the component directly change the values in the central state?
- What are reducer functions?
- What are actions?
- Can you explain the core Redux concepts? (**Favourite Interview Question - Asked in 99% of React interviews**)

---

## Watch video 5 from the above link and answer the following:

- What does `npm init` do?
- `npm init -y`, what does `-y` do here?
- Why do we see `counter value = 2` when the trainer writes `store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' })`?

---

## Deliverable

- Currently, when you call an action with type `increment`, the counter increases. Try increasing the counter by value `5` by dispatching the action `5` times.
- Now try calling the action with type `decrement`. Does the counter increase or decrease in value?
- Can you write the reducer function in such a manner that when the action with type `decrement` is called, the counter reducer should decrease in value? *(If stuck for long, check Hint 1.)*
